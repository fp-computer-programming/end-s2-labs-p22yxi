### Functions

---

Select 5 kata from codewars, covering topics we have gone over in class this semester. Write a function for each kata, adding a comment to every line 

Each function should be in a separate Python file named `Sem2-end-labs-#.py` where `#` is the number of the function. Be sure to include at least 3 tests of each function. Each function will be worth 3 points.

*HINT: Any time you prompt a user for an input, pass this value as an argument to the function.*

<p align="center">Be sure to commit your code before the deadline. Only the latest commit will be graded.</p>
